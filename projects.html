                            <p class="triot">A rock-solid trio session, with a top-shelf Italian groove pedigree as the group features two members from <a href="http://www.berardijazzconnection.com/" target="_blank"><span class="BJC">Berardi Jazz Connection</span></a>, and the pianist from Quintetto X!

The voyage started many years ago in the center of Taranto (south of Italy) on a street called Via Berardi where, Francesco had an apartment using it as a rehearsal studio. After many different experiences as “sideman” and different concerts around the world with both artists, in the year 2005 Francesco decided to “give life” to this project involving other Italian talents and international sp guests.</p>
